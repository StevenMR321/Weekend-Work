                <em>ABOUT ME</em>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Since 2011 I have been dedicated to the field of the electrical industry,<br>
                starting the process from the assistant level where I am for about 1 year, <br>
                until I manage to start my studies in 2012 and from there begin the promotion<br>
                hand in hand with the knowledge acquired and the fundamental value provided <br>
                by the Experience. Based on that, I have been able to perform throughout these <br>
                years in different projects with multiple construction companies throughout <br>
                the city and the department.
